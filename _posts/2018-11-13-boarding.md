# Stay at home boarding or respite care

Going to a boarding kennel can be a traumatic experience for many pets, which can leave them feeling anxious and distressed. I can stay with them in their own home where they will feel happy and relaxed. Not only will your pet feel safe and secure but you will have peace of mind knowing your house is secure too. 2 dog walks a day are included in the price. Pictures will be sent to you during the stay so you know they are doing well.

Prices: 

£45 for one day (inc overnight stay and a morning & evening walk).  

Deals done on longer stays.
