#Puppy/Kitten Visit

Duration varies • £8 per 30 minute visit

Leaving a puppy or kitten alone can be a stressful time for both us and our pets. Whether you are out at work or just need to get in the weekly shop I will happily pop in to check on them to make sure they're safe and well.

Longer visits can be arranged if you would prefer. Videos will be taken at each visit to show you that your pest are safe and well.
