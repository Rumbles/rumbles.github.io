# Puppy/Kitten Visit

Â£8 per 30 minute visit

Leaving a puppy or kitten alone can be a stressful time for both us and our pets. Whether you are out at work or just need to get in the weekly shop I will happily pop in to check on them to make sure they're safe and well.

Longer visits can be arranged. Videos will be taken at each visit to show you that your pets are having a lovely time.
