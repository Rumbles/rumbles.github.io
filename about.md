Hello, my name is Helen and I am the owner of Wilson Walks. I set up this company after me and my partner decided to adopt a 7 year old rescue dog named Taz. Taz was a timid little bear, who lacked confidence and was very reactive towards anything that moved. We sought advice from some great professionals and got stuck into training him. After a rollercoaster 6 months and a lot of hard work I realised that I wanted to spend more of my time with animals and decided to look in to dog walking and pet sitting as a full time career.

I live and work in Middlewood and Hillsborough, Sheffield and Iâ€™m looking to start working in December this year.

I am currently providing the following services:

 * Dog walking
 * Puppy sitting
 * Cat sitting
 * Stay at home boarding
 * Holiday pet sitting
 * Small animal feeding
 * From January 2019 I will also be providing a pet taxi service.

I am fully insured and pet first aid trained. I have worked as a civil servant for 4 years for which I had full background checks and security clearance. However, for your peace of mind I have also obtained a DBS check, which I will make available to view when we meet.

I am taking bookings now. If you would like to get in touch please either <a href="tel:07742795513">call me</a>, visit the <a href="/contact/">contact</a> page or <a href="mailto:helen@wilsonwalks.dog">email me</a>.
