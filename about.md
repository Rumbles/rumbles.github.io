Hello, my name is Helen and I am the owner of Wilson Walks. I set up this company after me and my partner adopted a 7 year old rescue dog named Taz. Taz is a timid little bear, who lacks confidence and can be very reactive towards anything that moves.

We sought advice from some great professionals and got stuck into training and confidence building. After a rollercoaster few months and a lot of hard work I realised that I wanted to spend more of my time with animals and decided to look in to dog walking and pet sitting as a full time career.

I am currently providing the following services:

 * Dog walking
 * Puppy visits
 * Cat sitting
 * Pet/house sitting
 * Holiday pet sitting
 * Small animal feeding
 * Pet taxi service

I am fully insured, DBS checked and pet first aid trained. I attend regular training courses and workshops to ensure I can provide the best possible care for your pet.

If you would like to get in touch please either <a href="tel:07742795513">call me</a>, visit the <a href="/contact/">contact</a> page or <a href="mailto:helen@wilsonwalks.dog">email me</a>.
