# Qualifications

I have taken a number of courses which will help me work with animals and care for them.
<style>
.zoom {
  transition: transform .2s; /* Animation */

  margin: 0 auto;
}

.zoom:hover {
  transform: scale(2); /* (150% zoom - Note: if the zoom is too large, it will go outside of the viewport) */
}
</style>

    <td><h3>Pet First Aid</h3>I felt it was a good idea to learn what to do in an emergency, just in case I ever had a situation when I had to care for an animal who has had an accident before we could get it to a vet. More information can be found on their <a href="https://www.propetfirstaid.co.uk/">website</a></td>

    <td><h3>Canine Body Language</h3>I wanted to learn more about reading Dog body language, as I felt it would help when walking and caring for them. More information can be found on the course <a href="https://www.dogtrainingcollege.co.uk/canine-body-language">website</a></td>
