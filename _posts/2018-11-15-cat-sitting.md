# Cat Sitting

Duration varies • £8 per 30 minute visit

This will include popping in once or twice a day to feed, top up water and clean out litter trays. If your kitty allows, we will happily stay longer for play and cuddles. A picture or video will be taken of your cat so you know they are happy and safe.
