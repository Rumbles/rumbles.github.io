    <td><h3>Pet First Aid</h3>I felt it was a good idea to learn what to do in an emergency, just in case I ever had a situation when I had to care for an animal who has had an accident before we could get it to a vet. More information can be found on their <a href="https://www.propetfirstaid.co.uk/">website</a></td>

    <td><h3>Canine Body Language</h3>I wanted to learn more about reading Dog body language, as I felt it would help when walking and caring for them. More information can be found on the course <a href="https://www.dogtrainingcollege.co.uk/canine-body-language">website</a></td>
