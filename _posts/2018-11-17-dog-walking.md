# Dog Walking

£10 per dog per hour

or

£7 per dog per half hour

We all know that work and life can get in the way of spending time with our canine companions. So for those days when you need an extra helping hand I can walk your dog as many times a day as they need. I will tailor the walks to suit your pooches needs, including solo walks for anxious dogs.

Discounts for additional dogs from the same household providing they can be walked together.
