# Pet Taxi

Whether it’s a lack of transport or lack of time, many people can struggle to visit the vet or groomers as often as they would like. I can ensure that your pets get to their appointment safely and on time. I will pick them up in my fully kitted out van and transport them to and from where they need to be.

Trips will be charged at £7. Each additional mile will be charged at £1 per mile.

The service will begin January 2019.
