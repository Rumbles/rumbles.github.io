I've always loved animals and have owned a number throughout my life, but last year me and my partner decided to get a rescue dog. After a rollercoaster 6 months I realised that I wanted to send more of my time with animals and decided to look in to dog walking and pet sitting as a full time career.

I have my Doggy First Aid certificate and I've been doing a lot of reward based obedience training and work with my own dog regularly to help him with his anxiety issues after a lifetime of negligence on a puppy farm.

I live and work in Middlewood and Hillsborough, Sheffield and I'm looking to start working in early 2019.

I plan on offering services for the following:

  * Dog Walking
  * Pet & House Sitting
  * Pet Taxi

I am still working on pricing, so please contact me if you're interested and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
